Hey! I am Clinton :wave: I just graduated with a Master of Applied Science (MASc) degree in electrical & computer engineering from [Ingenuity Labs](https://ingenuitylabs.queensu.ca), [Queen's University](https://www.queensu.ca). I had the honour to be co-supervised by Geoffrey Wai-Yip Chan and [Xiaodan Zhu](http://www.xiaodanzhu.com). I had the honour to be one of the recipients for the [Vector Scholarship in Artifical Intelligence](https://vectorinstitute.ai/programs/scholarship/).

My research thesis focused on applying state-of-the-art deep learning and NLP techniques to assist clinicians triage patients for the most appropriate treatment. This project gave me hands-on experience in analyzing voice-to-text transcripts and modelling multi-modal signals (natural language, speech, vision) with recurrent neural networks and Transformer-based models. I have published two papers, which I encourage you to go check them out in my Publications section!

Before grad school, I did my bachelor's degree in electrical engineering with a focus on digital signal processing. I had the opportunity to interned at Ericsson for over a year as an algorithm developer.

If you want to get in touch with me, just send me an email! And if you don't hear back from me right away, I am probably playing badminton, baking ,or watching F1 highlights. :smile:
