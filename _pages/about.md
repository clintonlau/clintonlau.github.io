Hey! I am Clinton :wave: I just graduated with a Master of Applied Science (MASc) degree in electrical & computer engineering from [Ingenuity Labs](https://ingenuitylabs.queensu.ca), [Queen's University](https://www.queensu.ca). I had the honour to be co-supervised by Geoffrey Wai-Yip Chan and [Xiaodan Zhu](http://www.xiaodanzhu.com). 

My thesis focused on using deep learning and NLP techniques to estimate a person's depression severity from clinical interview recordings. This project has given me hands-on experience with data analysis and modelling multimodal signals (natural language, speech, vision) with Transformer-based models in PyTorch. I have lead-authored two publications with very intuitive plots and figures, I encourage you to go check them out in my Publications section!

Before my master's, I did a BASc degree in electrical engineering, specializing in digital signal processing. I had the opportunity to work at Ericsson for over a year as a developer implementing software scripts and test frameworks in Python.

With a strong foundation and hands-on experience in machine learning and data science, I am ready to take on complex problems in a business environment. If you want to get in touch with me, send me an email! And if you don't hear back from me right away, I might be playing badminton, baking or, watching F1 highlights. :smile:

<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below.
